# ICE Portal for the Gnome Shell

Do you want to see how fast your current ICE is going while working on your laptop?
Today is your day!
This extension for the Gnome Shell allows you to receive the current speed of your ICE at regular intervals!
No more looking up to know how fast you are going :muscle:. 
Who knows, maybe this extension even allows for more information in the future?
